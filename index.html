                            <p>All of my working career, I had worked in Healthcare.  I love to help people.  In that time, I was always interested in the newest and greatest technology.  I started to learn how to code, and I fell in love with it.  I decided to put the two together. <br/>Now I can work with technology and also help others achieve their dreams.  <br />Currently, I am a Full Stack Web Developer student at Lambda School.</p>
