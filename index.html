    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>As a healthcare professional with over 20 years of experience, I have always been driven by the desire to help others and improve patient outcomes. While I am proud of the work I have accomplished in the healthcare field, I found myself yearning for a new challenge and a career that would allow me to combine my analytical skills with my passion for technology. This led me to pursue a career as a Full-Stack Engineer, where I have been able to leverage my problem-solving abilities and creativity to develop innovative software solutions that improve user experiences and drive business outcomes. </p>
        <p>Throughout my career in healthcare, I gained extensive experience in patient care and management, working in various healthcare settings such as hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes. I honed my communication and interpersonal skills by collaborating with healthcare teams to ensure optimal patient outcomes and satisfaction. I developed a strong attention to detail, maintaining accurate and detailed patient records and documentation. As I continued to grow in my role, I realized that I was also drawn to the technical aspects of healthcare, such as the use of electronic health records and other technologies to improve patient care.</p>
        
       <p>It was this interest in technology that eventually led me to explore a career as a Full-Stack Engineer. I was fascinated by the potential for software to drive innovation and improve user experiences in a wide range of industries. I was excited to apply my analytical skills and creativity to the field of software development, to design and build web applications that were not only visually appealing, but also functional and user-friendly.</p> 
<p>Since making the transition to a career in Full-Stack Engineering, I have continued to build on my healthcare experience, using my knowledge of healthcare and medical terminology to develop software solutions that support the healthcare industry. At the same time, I have been able to use my problem-solving skills to overcome technical challenges and to deliver high-quality software products that meet business requirements and user needs.</p>
<p>Overall, my journey from healthcare professional to Full-Stack Engineer has been both challenging and rewarding. It has allowed me to bring my analytical and creative abilities together in a way that enables me to make a positive impact on the world, both in healthcare and beyond.</p>
